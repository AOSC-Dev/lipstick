contents
========

src - a shared library
plugin - a QML plugin which exposes stuff to the QML engine
example - an example homescreen demonstrating the capabilities of the library

how to run the example
======================

1. Build the project.
   This involves a library, a qml plugin, and an example.
   They should compile without errors/warnings.

2. Place the library .so file under /usr/lib
   
   NOTE: 64 bit variants of some distributions use /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib

2. Place the plugin .so file and the qmldir file under /usr/lib/qt4/imports/org/nemomobile/lipstick
   
   NOTE: The warning about /usr/lib64 applies here too
   
3. The example app uses both the plugin an the shared library (this is actually intended),
   So both of them should be intact before you can run the example
   
   NOTE: if you use a properly packaged version of the library, you won't need to go through this trouble
