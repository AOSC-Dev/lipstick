what is this?
=============

this is Jolla's homescreen. it is not open source.

to build, make sure you've built and installed 'lipstick' correctly,
then just qmake/make/make install, and run 'lipstick'.

easy development
================

note that, for ease of development, if you run this from within a
directory containing a "main.qml", it will pick that up, and use it
as the source of the qml.

this means you can have fast turnaround just by scping the qml to device,
running from the directory you scp'd to, and hacking it repeatedly.
